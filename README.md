A simple i2c slave that read analog and digital inputs for a joystick hardware (to be pulled for a master like a raspberry pi). You can build only the AVR CI and some components to a low footprint â€¦

My idea is connect the raspberry pi with i2c channel to arduino uno or leonardo and implement a polling for values of joystick movements in x and y axis and a press event of the  joystick's z axis button of.
